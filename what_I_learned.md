event management and passing event is really great way to 
devlop app.

1.When inheritence,casting from parent to child and vise versa they are the same pointer.
But It is not the same in case of virtual inheritance.

2.In virtual inheritence,The child class contains a pointer to  the parent class.So,when I cast from child to parent the pointer change.
